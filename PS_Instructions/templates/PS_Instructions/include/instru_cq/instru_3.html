<p> In both stages, you choose between different options, as shown in the image below. </p>

<p> In the sampling stage, you will first see summary statistics for each option. Then, you will have the opportunity to learn more about the options by
    sampling through them.</p>

 <p>The following sampling rules apply:

At the beginning of each sampling round, you receive {% if choice %} one point{% elif not choice %} three points{% endif %}.

You can invest {% if choice %} this point {% elif not choice %} these points {% endif %} freely between all

three options. Points cannot be accumulated and therefore, {% if choice %} each point {% elif not choice %} all three

points {% endif %} must be invested in each round. </p>
