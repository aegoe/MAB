<p>In the decision stage, you will invest three final points between the three options. As in each sampling round, you receive {% if choice %} one
    point{% elif not choice %} three points{% endif %} and can invest {% if choice %} this point {% elif not choice %} these points {% endif %} freely between 
    all three options. </p>

<p>After submitting your investment, a feedback screen summarizes the number of draws per option and informs you about the respective values of each coin drawn.
These values are summed up on the blue button below the feedback table. By clicking on the button, you will finish the main task and proceed to the questionnaire. </p>

{%if choice%}
<p> In contrast to the sampling stage, you will receive feedback only after you made three consecutive investments. Thus, you will decide how to allocate your point three times, and only then receive feedback about your three choices. </p>

{% endif %}



<!--{% if not choice %}-->
<!--<p>Once you have made your choice, you will receive feedback about the payoff from your investment. This will be shown on a separate feedback screen upon submitting your choice. </p>-->

<!--{% elif choice %}-->
<!--<p> Once you made three consecutive choices, you will receive feedback about the payoff from your investment. Thus, you will-->
<!--receive feedback after the third and after the sixth round. This will be shown on a separate feedback screen.</p>-->
