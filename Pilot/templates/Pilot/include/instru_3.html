<p> You can think of each option as a bag of coins. The coins are put in each bag before the game starts and for every point you invest in
an option, a coin from the respective bag is drawn. After each draw, the coin is put back into the bag. Coins in the bag usually differ in value.
    Each bag can differ in the average value of coins it contains. Some options are better than others and you can find that out by 
    choosing options and observing the coins you draw. </p>

<p> The label denoting the option (e.g., &quot;Option B&quot;) and an option's position on the screen are determined randomly before the experiment starts. 
    Label and position can help you locate a particular option, but they are not related to the amount of rewards you can get from an option.


    Throughout the game you collect experimental coins and with each choice the amount increases or decreases depending on the draw from on an option.</p>
