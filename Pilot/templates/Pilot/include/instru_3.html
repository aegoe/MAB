<p> You can think of each option as a bag of coins. The coins are put in each bag before the game starts and every time you choose
an option you draw a coin from the bag. Afterwards, the coin is put back into the bag. Coins in the bag usually differ in value.
    Each bag can differ in the average value of the coins it contains.</p>

<p>
In the first round you will know almost nothing about the options and will have to guess which option will help you increase your amount of coins. 
With time you can learn about the bags and make better choices. The more coins you earn during the game, the more money you will receive for your participation.

    Throughout the game you collect experimental coins and with each choice the amount increases or decreases depending on the draw from on an option.</p>
