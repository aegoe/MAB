<p> You can think of each option as a bag of coins. The coins are put in each bag before the game starts and for every point you invest in
an option, a coin from the respective bag is drawn. After each draw, the coin is put back into the bag. Coins in the bag usually differ in value.
    Each bag can differ in the average value of coins it contains. Some options are better than others and you can find that out by 
    choosing options and observing the coins you draw. </p>

<p> After submitting your investment, a feedback screen summarizes the number of draws per option and informs you about the respective values of each drawn coin.
    These values are summed up and indicated as your total earnings in this round on the button below the feedback table. By clicking on this button, you will start the next round. </p>
    
<p> The label denoting the option (e.g., a triangle on the bag) and an option's position on the screen are randomly predetermined and fixed. 
    Label and position can help you locate a particular option, but they are not related to the amount of rewards you can get from an option. </p>
