<p>Welcome to this HIT! All your responses will be kept completely confidential and you will remain
 anonymous. </p>

 <p> In this HIT you can – depending on your decisions – earn money in addition to
the {{ participation_fee }} that you receive as a fixed payoff. It is thus very important that you
read the instructions carefully. After you have completed the main task, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire. You
will be paid as soon as you have completed both the task and the questionnaire.</p>

<p>During the HIT, we will not speak of Dollars, but Coins. Your entire payoff will first be calculated in
    Coins. The Coins you earn during the HIT will be converted to Dollars at the end of the HIT. The following
    conversion rate applies:</p>

<p align="center">10 Coins = {{ conversion_factor }} Cents </p>

<p>We will explain the exact procedure of the HIT on the next pages.</p>
