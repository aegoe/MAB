<p> You will now start the sampling phase. You will make 100 decisions on how to allocate one point between the three options. After each decision, you receive feedback about the return of your draw. </p>

<p> Points invested during the sampling stage do not count towards your bonus. However, you should use them to learn more about the options before your main investment decision.</p>
