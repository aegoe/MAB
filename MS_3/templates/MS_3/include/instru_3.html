<p> At the beginning of stage "ONE", you will learn about the options by observing provided information. Afterwards, you make {% if choice %} three consecutive 
    investment decisions that determine {% elif not choice %} one investment decision that determines {% endif %} your bonus
    payoff. Stage "ONE" is than finsihed and you will directly be forwarded to stage "TWO".
     </p>

<p> At stage "TWO", you will be able to learn more about the options, you already know from stage "ONE", by sampling through them. After you have done sampling, 
    again, you will make another {% if choice %} three consecutive investment decisions that determine 
    {% elif not choice %} investment decision that determines {% endif %} your bonus payoff. 
   Afterwards, you will receive feedback about your investment decisions from stage "ONE" and "TWO" and 
    will be informed about your bonus payoff.  
</p>

   
    
    <h6>Stage "TWO" <\h6>
 <p> In order to learn more about the options, stage "TWO" consists of 100 rounds, where you can draw 
     more coins from each option by investing points.
    These coins will not affect your final payoff, but they will give you additional information about the potential value of each option.
    
Again, at the beginning of each sampling round, you receive {% if choice %} one point{% elif not choice %} three points{% endif %}. 

You can invest {% if choice %} this point {% elif not choice %} these points {% endif %} freely between all 

three options. Points cannot be accumulated and therefore, {% if choice %} each point {% elif not choice %} all three 

points {% endif %} must be invested in each round. </p>
