<p>In this HIT, you will complete two stages. In each stage, you will choose among same set of different options to receive Coins.
Each option is represented by a money bag, as shown in the image below. You choose options by investing points.</p> 
</p>

<p>You can think of each option as a bag of coins. The coins are put in each bag before the game starts and for every point you invest in
an option, a coin from the respective bag is drawn. Thus, one point equals one draw. After each draw, the coin is put back into the bag. Bags do not change over the 
course of the task and are independent of one another. However, bags differ in the composition of coins they contain.</p>

<p>  At the beginning of the task, you will see summary statistics from {{Constants.num_priors}} prior
draws from each of the three options. You can use this data to inform your subsequent choices in the sampling as well as the decision stage.</p>

<!--<p> This HIT comprises <b>two stages</b> and you will repeatedly choose between different options. In the first stage (<b>sampling stage</b>),-->
    <!--you will learn about the options value by getting descriptions for each option and second you will get the opportunity to learn more by sampling through-->
    <!--the options. The second stage includes your final decision (<b>decision stage</b>), where you can apply your gained knowledge and make a final choice.</p>-->



<!--{% if not choice %}-->
